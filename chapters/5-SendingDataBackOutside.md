# Sending Data Back to the Outside World

- Explain the various options we have for sending things back out to the host machine / outside world.
- For this example, we'll save the CSV file on the host machine and also send a copy out over the network via email or FTP or something
- This completes the simple ETL project
- Make sure tests are passing
