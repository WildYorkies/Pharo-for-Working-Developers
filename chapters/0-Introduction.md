# Why Pharo

_This is a random thought I just had. Take it with a grain of salt._

Let's start by thinking about the nice aspects of Ruby. 

One of the biggest problems with Ruby is the abstraction of details away from developers. 

Why is this a problem? Well, developers often run into issues or need to change the way a library works. Then the developer goes on a wild goose chase trying to find where some functionality actually resides!

Pharo is taking all the best parts of Ruby and fixing that problem I just mentioned. Abstracting or hiding complex functionality from an end user is not an issue _as long as_ it is trivial for the developer to look into it if they need to. Pharo makes it very trivial indeed to discover these underlying hidden parts. Pharo is essentially Visual Studio for Ruby, but even more.

Pharo takes the "don't ask don't tell" approach to abstraction. But even better, if you _want_ to ask, it is very easy to do so.

Abstraction + Discoverability = True developer happiness.
