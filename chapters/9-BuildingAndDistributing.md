# Building and Distributing

Now that we have a completed project, how do we build/package/distribute this?

- Does the end user also need to have Pharo?
- Does my VM automatically get rid of the objects it isn't using/doesn't need?
- Call the application from the command line. How to?
- Where to host this and set it to run on a schedule?
