# Pharo-for-Working-Developers

Other title ideas were:
- Pharo for Python Developers
- Pharo for Node Developers
- Pharo for Non-Students
- Pharo for People that Already Understand OOP

The goal is to create a short book to get teams up and running on best practices for using Pharo to Get Things Doneâ„¢ 

This book walks through the creation of a simple ETL "script". Something that many developers are familiar with in other languages.

The book will showcase up-to-date best practices for Version Control, Deployment, Package Management, etc. 

It's not so much about Pharo the language or the project that we build. It's more about the set-up and workflow from the trenches.
